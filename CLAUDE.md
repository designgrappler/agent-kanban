# Agent Kanban

Agent-first kanban board. React SPA + Hono API on Cloudflare Workers + D1.

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## Architecture
- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces
- Frontend: apps/web/src/ — React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: apps/web/server/ — Hono API, repo layer, auth, SSE
- Worker entry: apps/web/worker/index.ts — exports Hono app + TunnelRelay DO
- Build: @cloudflare/vite-plugin — produces client assets + worker bundle
- Database: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- Durable Objects: TunnelRelay (WebSocket relay for daemon ↔ browser)
- CLI: packages/cli/ — TypeScript, published to npm
- Shared types: packages/shared/ — proper package with build step
- Agent skill: skills/agent-kanban/ — installed via `npx skills add` to target repos

## UI Principles
- **Human-editable backlog** — tasks in `todo` status can be created, edited, and deleted from the browser by humans (product backlog management)
- **Locked once claimed** — tasks in any other status (`in_progress`, `in_review`, `done`, `cancelled`) are read-only in the UI; no edit/delete affordances are shown
- **No status transition buttons** — no claim/cancel/release/assign in the UI; agents drive their own lifecycle via CLI/API
- **No drag-and-drop** — card ordering is managed by agents
- **No repo picker** — repository assignment is automatic via the board's `default_repository_id`
- **Only two review actions in UI**: reject (send back to agent) and complete (accept) — can be performed by humans or lead agents via API
- Board switcher and task detail (logs, PR, chat) are the only navigation interactions outside of backlog editing

## Patterns
- Data access: thin repo layer (taskRepo.ts, boardRepo.ts, agentRepo.ts, messageRepo.ts) — no raw SQL in route handlers
- Error handling: Hono onError + HTTPException — centralized error envelope { error: { code, message } }
- Claim atomicity: db.batch() for race-condition-free task claims
- Auth: Three identity types — **user** (Better Auth session), **machine** (@better-auth/api-key), **agent** (@better-auth/agent-auth Ed25519 JWT). Machines assign tasks; agents claim/review with own JWT. Data scoped by `owner_id`.
- Agent identity: registered via `POST /api/agents` with Ed25519 public key. Each agent has a cryptographic identity (identicon, fingerprint). Daemon generates ephemeral keypair per spawn.
- Agent status: idle → working (on claim/assign) → idle (on complete/release/cancel with no other active tasks) → offline (on stale timeout)
- Task lifecycle: Todo → Todo+assigned (daemon assign) → In Progress (agent claim) → In Review (agent review+PR) → Done (reviewer complete) or Cancelled (cancel at any stage). Reviewer = human or lead agent.
- Task dependencies: `depends_on` JSON array, cycle detection via recursive CTE (taskDeps.ts), `blocked` computed on read
- Task origin: `created_from` for single-level subtask tracking
- Stale detection: write-on-read in GET /api/boards/:id and inline before assign (taskStale.ts). 2h timeout, idempotent.
- SSE: TransformStream-based, 2s poll for 25s (CF Workers limit), Last-Event-ID resume via log ID → timestamp resolution (sse.ts). Emits typed events (`event: log` for task_logs, `event: message` for messages).
- Messages: `messages` table for human ↔ agent chat. `agent_id` = agent CLI session ID (used for `claude --resume`). D1 as message bus — daemon polls for human messages, browser reads via SSE.
- Machine daemon: `ak start` — poll loop, auto-claim todo tasks, spawn agent CLI per task. PID lock, graceful shutdown, exponential backoff. `processManager.ts` handles spawn/monitor/kill/chat relay.
- Repo management: `ak create repo` registers repo at tenant level. `ak get repo` lists registered repos.
- Data model: Board is the workspace unit. Repositories belong to owner (tenant-level, like machines). Tasks belong to boards, optionally linked to a repository. Machines belong to owner (user/org).

## Post-Write Workflow
After every significant code change, follow this sequence:

1. **Test** — invoke test-writer agent to write/update unit/integration tests and run them.
   - If changes touch frontend components (`apps/web/src/`), also invoke playwright-test-generator agent to create/update E2E tests, and playwright-test-healer to fix any broken existing E2E tests.
   - ALL PASS → proceed to step 2.
   - FAILURES → you (main agent) read the failure, decide if the bug is in source code or test code.
     - Source bug → fix the source code, re-run tests yourself.
     - Test bug → state why the test is wrong, then forward to test-writer (unit) or playwright-test-healer (E2E) agent to fix.
   - After all tests pass, proceed to step 2.
2. **Review** — invoke clean-code-reviewer agent (reviews both source and test code).
   - REVISE on source code → you (main agent) fix, then re-run review.
   - REVISE on test code → forward issues to the appropriate test agent to fix.
   - PASS → proceed to step 3.

**Ownership rule**: you (main agent) only modify source code. Test code is owned by test agents — all test modifications go through them.
3. **Regression** — run build + type check + full test suite to catch breakage.
   - `pnpm build && pnpm tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run`
   - Any failure → fix and re-run. If fix touches source code, go back to step 1.
4. **Daemon smoke test** — if changes touch daemon code (`packages/cli/src/daemon/`), run `./scripts/daemon-smoke-test.sh` and ensure it passes before considering the task done.
   - Before smoke, always refresh the local CLI with `bash scripts/install-cli.sh`.
   - Smoke is mandatory. Missing arguments are not a reason to skip it: discover existing resources with `ak get board -o json`, `ak get repo -o json`, and `ak get agent -o json`, or create the missing resources.
   - The default smoke target is the Demo board with the `slink` repository. The smoke script auto-discovers these defaults when arguments are omitted.

## Testing
- Framework: vitest (root `vitest.config.ts`)
- Run: `npx vitest run`
- Run with coverage: `npx vitest run --coverage --coverage.include='<glob>'`
- Coverage provider: `@vitest/coverage-v8` (install with `pnpm add -Dw @vitest/coverage-v8` if missing)
- Tests in `tests/` directory
- Unit/integration tests: `*.test.ts` — direct import of modules, real D1 via Miniflare (no mocks)
- E2E tests: `*.spec.ts` — Playwright browser tests
- Test data setup: Miniflare D1 with migrations from `apps/web/migrations/`, seed helpers in test files

## Agent OS Configuration

### Initialization Loop (Every Session)

Before any work, read:
1. `AGENTIC.md` — Static DNA (tech stack, team, protocols, hard constraints)
2. `docs/context/plan.md` — Current sprint objective
3. `docs/context/tracks.md` — Active tracks and their status

---

### Execution Protocol

**No execution without a Handoff Bridge.**

All work must flow through:
```
Conductor (approval) → Peaches (plan + Handoff Bridge) → Skylar (execute) → Bandit (quality gate)
```

A Handoff Bridge looks like:
```
### HANDOFF BRIDGE
**Topic:** [Feature/Bug Name]
**Track:** [ID from tracks.md]
**Static DNA Check:** [Confirmed alignment with AGENTIC.md]
**Dynamic DNA State:**
- Product Context: [1-sentence requirement]
- Current Plan: [step in plan.md]
- Execution Files: [files to modify]
**Worktree Setup:** [git worktree command or "N/A — single active track"]
**Verification:** [command or URL]
**Next Step:** [specific task for the Specialist]
```

---

### Worktree Protocol

Each track gets an isolated branch and worktree:
```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/track-N track/N-description
```

Worktrees live in `.worktrees/` (gitignored). Never work directly on the main branch for multi-track sprints.

---

### Stability Rules

- **Circuit Breaker:** 3 consecutive failures with the same root cause → STOP. Call Peaches for Red Flag Analysis. Any destructive or irreversible failure triggers an immediate stop.
- **Git Hygiene:** No commits unless Tim directs.
- **Sentinel Proof:** Never trust a verbal summary. Verify with `git diff` or file reads.

### Auto-Invocations

Invoke the following skills automatically when the user's message matches these patterns — do not wait to be asked explicitly:

| User says... | Invoke |
|---|---|
| "start planning", "new sprint", "let's plan", "begin planning", "what are we working on next" | `/open-sprint` |
| "catch me up", "what's the status", "where are we", "status check", "quick update" | `/report-track-status` |
